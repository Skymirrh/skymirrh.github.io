This is a thin-wrapper GitHub Pages user site that redirects older GitHub Pages project sites hosted
under my previous GitHub account to their counterparts hosted under my new GitHub account, since
[GitHub does not set up redirects for GitHub Pages when changing username](https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/changing-your-github-username).

It takes advantage of [`jekyll-redirect-from`](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-redirect-from#redirect-to)
to setup simple HTML `<meta http-equiv="refresh" ...>` tags from YAML.
